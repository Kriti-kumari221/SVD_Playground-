# Spectral Decomposition 

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`Spiral_Decomposition.ipynb`) that demonstrates spectral decomposition of a square matrix. The code includes:
- Input of a square matrix.
- Computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors using NumPy.
- Reconstruction of the matrix using the spectral decomposition formula.
- Visualization of the original and reconstructed matrices using heatmaps.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `Spectral-Decomposition/Spiral_Decomposition.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells to input a matrix, compute the decomposition, and view the results.
4. Heatmaps will display the original and reconstructed matrices.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
